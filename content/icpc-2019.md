## What are they?

ICPC stands for *International Collegiate Programming Contest* and is an important worldwide coding competition that takes place
online and is open to the world. The opportunity is open to any undergraduate University across the world.

ICPC are probably the most famous **Competitive Programming** competition, alongside the **International Olympiads in Informatics** (IOI).

We at **GRASP** train teams that are expected to strike hard at the ICPC. What we miss is humans to train, so why not come forward?

## Doubts?

Have a look on [the ACM ICPC FAQ](https://icpc.baylor.edu/compete/faq) for details about how the contest actually works.

## Want to join?

Great! Here's the procedure.

1. Find people who may want to be your dream team. Do you struggle to find them? Read the next section.
2. Once you found them, head to https://icpc.baylor.edu and press "signup" and register
3. Create a team (Choose Europe contests -> "The 2018 Northwestern Europe Regional Contest" -> "The 2018 UK & Ireland Programming Contest" -> "University of Glasgow")
4. Add your teammates details, and your coach will accept your team.

The registered coach is Adam Kurkiewicz ([adam@kurkiewicz.pl](mailto:adam@kurkiewicz.pl) so contact him in case you struggle.

All the students who join will be trained by Adam, the author of this post (Enrico Trombetta, [trombetta.enricom@pm.me](mailto:trombetta.enricom@pm.me)) and probably even more skillful people. Remember, the more we are, the better!

## Struggling to find a team?

Don't feel ashamed. It's quite difficult to find motivated people during the lectures. On that case, just contact us directly (use the email given above or the contact link on the menu).
