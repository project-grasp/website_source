The talent misconception has always been a strong deterrent towards initiative. Many people believe they won't go any further because they lack of talent and thus stop working hard on their dreams. This is a catch 22, and we at GRASP want to stop it from happening on.

When you decide to join **GRASP**, either you are a student willing to learn something or a senior student/alumnus tutoring other people, you'll put a lot on effort on it. Even if you feel astonished because of people working restlessly next to you remember they have worked hard to achieve their level.

We at **GRASP** take this point seriously and it has become our mission.
