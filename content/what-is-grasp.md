Project Grasp is an initiative targeting students from local Glasgow high schools, organised at University of Glasgow by Adam Kurkiewicz, Dr. William Petterson and Prof. Quintin Cutts in partnership with Skyscanner. We solve puzzles, build things, break things, play with computers and maths and take part in various competitions. Check it out -- you might actually like it!
