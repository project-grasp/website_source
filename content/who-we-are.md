## What is Project GRASP?

**Project GRASP** is a Student Society located in the University of Glasgow that make high school students unleash their potential and achieve or - how we prefer to say - *grasp* their dream and ambitions. We have a deep love for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects, in particular Mathematics and Computer Science, and want to spread it to the whole Glasgow and Scotland and, someday, to the UK.

## What do you do? Are you different from other tech societies?

Usually tech societies have a focus on engineering only, neglecting the fascinating world of Maths and Pure Computer Science. However the world as we know it has deep roots on the foundations of the Sciences. Just think of Machine Learning without Statistics, Cryptocurrencies without cryptography, Game Development without geometry and the SpaceX project without astrophysics.

Without diminishing the great value of Engineering, our aim is to unveil the underlying theoretical lattice of the world and find out that it isn't pretty theoretical all in all!

## Who can take part to GRASP?

In a nutshell: mainly high school students of age 13-18 but everybody is welcome.

GRASP is fundamentally for High School students who want food for thought but we are not so exclusive. We make classes for Olympiads (BIO, BMO and others coming soon), recreational mathematics, Python coding, software development and engineering and automated theorem proving - [see our Lean workshops](/lean_workshops).

If you are an undergradate student you may pop in to training for ACM ICPC contests (in the case, check out the ICPC 2019 link in the menu), although this is an **unofficial activity** done by some GRASP members.

If you have an experience to share with high school students, just share it. We truly believe that your testimonials can make the difference.
