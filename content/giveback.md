It is not just problems and concepts that were taught at project Grasp. We were also taught
how to think for ourselves and as a team; how to tackle problems where we had no idea
how and how to develop ourselves on our own as well. <br>

<blockquote>
The biggest impact of Project Grasp for me was that it helped me achieve an offer from
Oxford University to study Mathematics. Not only did I mention Grasp in my personal
statement, but the questions I faced there were similar to the ones that I had to answer as
part of the admissions exam to study at the university. When I was asked to an interview in
Oxford the questions I was asked were also quite similar to the questions faced at Grasp
and the fact that I had attempting these questions many times may have impressed the
interviewers enough to get me an offer to study there.

<blockquote>
My communication skills have definitely improved as working on the project in a group
required you to talk to other people and find out what tasks they were doing. Every morning
we would have a retrospective, where we talked about our successful tasks that we did or
issues we had with our tasks. We were very organised by making sure tasks are clear and
achievable, this would allow us to make full use of the two weeks and time was not wasted.
